## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
 
## Notes

Some challenges I faced when building the app:
-I wasn't very familar with XCode, setting up the proper workspace was a bit challenging. 
-I accidentily tried to drag the button to the storyboard instead of the code file which created a segue instead of a IBAction for the button. 
-Forgot to set the ViewController class in the storyboard whihc broke button connection. 
-Had to learn how to use assistant editor to create the correct IBAactions

An app idea i would like to build would be a protien app tracker. Even though these already exist I want to create one that is more innovative and easy to use. As someone who is into to fitness it can get difficult managing all the protien you intake throughout the day. The protien tracker app will prompt a user to enter their height, weight, and age as well as to take a short quiz on the kinds of food they enjoy. The app will create a personalized protien goal where they can input protien in grams or oz until they reach the goal. The app will also have a feature of differnt meals that are healthy and protien packed based on the short quiz the user took in the beginning of signing up for the app.
